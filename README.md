## About Project

JustApply is an MVP job tracking application that helps users keep track of job application listings and the application status.  From designing, to planning out the functionality, data structure, and logic flows, I developed this full application by implementing my skills in  Laravel-Blade, BootstrapVue, Laravel-Breeze, Eloquent ORM and Laravel-Sail.

## Features added to the project

- Implemented user account creation/Authentication.
- Implemented ability to create job application listing to be tracked on a user's account.
- Implemented ability to update job application status.

## Future updates.
- Re update the project to utilize Laravel/Vue and bootstrap 5

- Update authentication to use Laravel/Jetstream instead of Breeze.

- I also would like to do further design for the project to make it mobile-friendly to support specific mobile devices. 

I would also have liked to add additional features from the original mock-up. 
  - Such as live notifications for users to set reminders for interviews
  - Allow users to take and upload resumes to each job posting to keep track or to reuse one if needed
  - As well as allow users to add favorite job listings.
