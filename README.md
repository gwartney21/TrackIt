## About Project
JustApply is an MVP job tracking application that allows users to take and keep track of all their job applications. As well as update their application status. 
This application is built with Laravel/Blade, BootstrapVue, while utilizing Laravel/Breeze for user authentication and the Eloquent ORM to handle user data.

## Specific features added to the project
- Users can create an account
- Users can add specific job listings to their accounts to be referenced.
- Users can take and update the status of each job based on the application process.

## Future updates.
- Re update the project to utilize Laravel/Vue and bootstrap 5

- Update authentication to use Laravel/Jetstream instead of Breeze.

- I also would like to do further design for the project to make it mobile-friendly to support specific mobile devices. 

I would also have liked to add additional features from the original mock-up. 
  - Such as live notifications for users to set reminders for interviews
  - Allow users to take and upload resumes to each job posting to keep track or to reuse one if needed
  - As well as allow users to add favorite job listings.
